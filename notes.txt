todo: bugs
- Undo is pretty broken
- Ocassionaly, clicking clips appends-to instead of replacing selection
- Moving a clip to a locked track deletes the clip
- Moving clips to different tracks locks them in that track
- Opening projects might cause ticks in the timeline disappear

todo: snap resize clip to grid 
- clip editor: toggle between seconds, frames, beats units for viewing and editing
- slide audio within clip tool
x bug: reorganizing clip throws assertion error

TODO:
x Implement own panel component perhaps?
x Implement piano roll editor area
x Move MidiDemo piano roll into new piano roll editor
x Figure out how to save and load data, so piano roll midi lives in clips

MAYBE: 
- Switch audio timing to be frames, for maximum precision (avoid time floats)
