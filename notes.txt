todo: snap resize clip to grid 
clip editor: toggle between seconds, frames, beats units for viewing and editing
slide audio within clip tool
bug: reorganizing clip throws assertion error

TODO:
- Implement own panel component perhaps?
- Implement piano roll editor area
- Move MidiDemo piano roll into new piano roll editor
- Figure out how to save and load data, so piano roll midi lives in clips

MAYBE: 
- Switch audio timing to be frames, for maximum precision (avoid time floats)
